# Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life for CS

## Rules

A cell has eight neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals)

For a space that is populated:
* Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
* Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.
* Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.

For a space that is empty or unpopulated
* Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
